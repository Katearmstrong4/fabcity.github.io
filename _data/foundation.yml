title: Fab City <br/> Foundation
subtitle: Recently we saw the need to generate a certain organizational structure,
  so we have launched the Fab City Foundation. The foundation has been established
  as a legal and organizational structure in Estonia to enable the location-independent
  work of the globally distributed Fab City community. It is enabled by the Estonian
  e-Residency program which allows individuals and organizations the ability to function
  more seamlessly across borders and bureaucratic lines.
