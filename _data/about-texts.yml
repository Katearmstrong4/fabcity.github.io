title1: "Our global Context"
text1: "In an ever-changing world innovation is not an option, it is a necessity. Climate change and social exclusion require us to reinvent the fundamental systems which we depend upon, a task which requires courage, coherence and long-term thinking. The rate at which humans consume planetary resources is putting the systems of our planet and ourselves at risk. In order to revert the consequences of rapid urbanization, we need a deep transformation of how we organize production and consumption in cities."

title2: "The rise of the maker"
text2a: "The power of making is not limited to industry anymore, neither the power of innovating. Access to tools is widespread today, through the expansion of Fab Labs, Hacker Spaces and Maker Spaces around the world. Fab City recognizes this global trend and looks to scale up the potential of digital fabrication tools in Fab Labs and makerspaces to design, develop, create, and deploy the technologies that will reconfigure the relationship between consumption and production in cities."
text2b: "Fab City builds upon the thousands of spaces, and communities around them, that are democratizing disciplines such as engineering, biology, computation, arts and fabrication to enable the global movement of knowledge around how we make things, and how our cities function."

title3: "Locality"
text3a: "Fab City inspires and calls to action those with the intuition or the certainty that things need to be different in their locality for change to occur on a planetary scale. In each Fab City, citizens are empowered to be the masters of their own future. Civic space becomes a ecology of opportunity, by offering citizens new knowledge, skills, materials and ways to collaborate."
text3b: " Through access to open source digital designs found in global networks, consumers become ‘prosumers’, responsible for the customisation and fabrication of products to suit their needs. With the assumption of such productive power also comes an increased sense of ownership, identity and belonging and citizens are more willing to reinvest in the social and cultural fabric of their city."
